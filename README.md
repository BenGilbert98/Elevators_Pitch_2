Elevators Pitch
Hello, my name is Ben I am from the UK and am a masters graduate from the university of hull. I have a very strong background in technology which is an area that I am very passionate about and was a major factor in my degree choice.
I have managed to achieve a 1st in my master’s degree through which I got hands on experience with  CAD/CAM, 3D printing and stress analysis. I was able to be a part of wide variety of projects which allowed me to build upon my personal skills as well develop other areas such as python and MATLAB. Using this, I further studied python and cloud based computing in my spare time and perused qualifications in CAD and python. I would consider myself to be a driven individual and have goals to further develop my skills in python and AWS and accomplish further qualifications in these areas.
My interests have shifted towards IT instead of engineering. Specifically, I chose to pursue DevOps because it’s an area of technology which interests me, and I feel that I would be able to use my skills along with Sparta’s training to increase the efficiency at which organisations deliver applications and services and deliver in shipping high quality software to customers by bridging the gaps between application and development teams. 
Thanks
