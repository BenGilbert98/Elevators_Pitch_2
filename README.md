# Elevators_Pitch_2

Hello, my name is Ben, I have a strong background in technology which has always fascinated me and was a major factor in choosing my Mechanical Engineering degree.

I have managed to achieve a 1st in my masterâ€™s degree through which I got hands on experience with things like CAD/CAM and 3D printing. In my own time I was able to develop my knowledge of python and cloud based computing having achieved qualifications in CAD and python.

I feel that my interests have shifted more towards IT instead of engineering. Specifically, I chose DevOps to pursue because its an area of technology which interests me and I feel that I would be able to use my skills to increase the efficiency at which organisations deliver applications and servicees
